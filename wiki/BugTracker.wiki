  * Skills & Skill descriptions Unreadable
  * 3rd Job skills do not work for most classes
  * Some items crash client KappaRO-HamachiR1
  * Several bugs associated with Training Grounds

~Thusly, users are recommended they skip the Training Grounds, and furthermore that only players with experience with Ragnarok Online participate in server play for the time being. (ADM Synthetic, 1/21/11 12:51am EST)

  * Select jobs have limited clothing palettes. All classes are valid for styles 1-3, but for some classes any style above those indexes will crash the client. *PLEASE SEE THE PROJECT STATUS UNDER NOTES.*
  * Public chat does not register in the chatbox, overhead displays only.

~Therefore, it is strongly suggested that users join a party upon initial logon so they view chat history. (ADM Synthetic, 1/21/11 12:54am EST)
