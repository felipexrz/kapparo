#summary General Server Info

= KappaRO =

KappaRO is a Ragnarok Online game server.
The server is still under development, and has not yet been launched.

From the day of launch, we will be using the most up-to-date 3ceam SVN *trunk* release. NOT the stable. This means that there still may be bugs during gameplay, and you can view the current bug tracker on the 3ceam boards. If you do find a bug during gameplay, please report it to an Admin and we will check and see if it is documented. This will help the development of the 3ceam project.

= Playing KappaRO - User Guidelines =

<font color=RED> *It is strongly recommended that all players view the bugtracker wiki page before playing.*
