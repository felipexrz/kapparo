#summary General Server Info

= KappaRO =

KappaRO is a Ragnarok Online game server.
The server is still under development, and has not yet been launched.

From the day of launch, we will be using the most up-to-date 3ceam SVN *trunk* release. NOT the stable. This means that there still may be bugs during gameplay, and you can view the current bug tracker on the 3ceam boards. If you do find a bug during gameplay, please report it to an Admin and we will check and see if it is documented. This will help the development of the 3ceam project.


= Details =

     * Latest 3ceam trunk
     * Dual class system underway, please see Dual Class wiki page.
     * Frequent downtime until client is thoroughly tested by staff.
     * Once above is done, you will be given a downtime schedule. 
       It will be listed here, and on the new forum page. 

     * Google Code page administered by Synthetic
     * Web forum administered by Kachan
