== Meet The Staff ==

<font color = PURPLE>
==== [ADM]Â kattun ===
<font color =BLACK>
I'm the server administrator!<br>
I've been playing for about two years now, and have been running KappaRO for about a year. Kappa was down from the spring and over the summer, but I'm very happy to bring everything back online under the Legacy Release!

*Server Specs*
  * Latest 3ceam trunk
  * SQL
  * SHR: 100000x100000x100000

I look forward to seeing you online!

==== [GM] KaChan ====
<font color=black>
I'm the head of our GM staff and assistant to Kattun!<br>
Playing Ragnarok for nearly 7 years, I've been a GM on three different servers. I typically play midrate servers. Me and Kattun started Kappa together near the end of last year. I also fulfill administrative duties in Kattun's absence, and I write scripts for the random quests you may see on the road!

Need any help? Don't be shy to ask!<br>
See you there~

==== SEN Kathulhu ====
<font color=BLACK>
I'm a Senpai!<br>
I've been playing RO for about a year, I believe. During that time, I worked alongside KaChan and Kattun as a GM. As a Senpai, I ensure that any new members of KappaRO are welcomed into the game with a helping hand. <br><br>I've been with KappaRO since it's founding, so if you're lost or need assistance with something, don't be afraid to ask questions!
I'll see you when you get there, Comrades!<br><br>
