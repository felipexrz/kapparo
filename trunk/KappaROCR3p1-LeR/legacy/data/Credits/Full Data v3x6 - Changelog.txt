2006/05/03
	* After receiving confirmating info from Vicious_Pucca, changed items 4173 (Demon Pungus Card) and 4301 (Killer Mantis Card) to show 20% of autocast,
	  thanks to qazqazqaz for reporting this error. [Haplo]

2006/05/02
	* Changed Dancer Throw Arrow skill description to Casting Time 1.5 sec and no Cool Down, apparently the official descriptions are wrong.
	  Thanks to Zeno83 for reporting and Tharis for confirming this anomaly. [Haplo]

2006/05/01
	* In the "Required For" field of skill descriptions, removed (L1) for those skills that have only 1 level,
	  since is redundant. Also rearrenged some skill fields, so they follow the Template order. [Haplo]
	* Changed all "Casting Time = 0" to "Casting Time = Instant". [Haplo]
	* Fixed Absorb Spirits description, thanks to Skotlex for pointing it out. [Haplo]

	* Fixes of consistency and typos in the item descriptions. [Haplo]
	* Minor adjustment to Defender skill description. [Haplo]

	  but when used in a compound word like this one (that means Wind Demon), the reading change to Fuu (on-yomi), as in taifuu, ofuro, etc.
	  Since is a japanese word, japanese rules apply. Thanks to Remoldy Blach for pointing it out. [Haplo]

2006/04/26
	* Changed "Cinocas Case File" to "Shinokas Case File" [Poki#3]
	* Changed "Arrow" to "Ammunition" in msgstringtable.txt so that it applies to Gunslingers as well as Archers. [Poki#3]
	* Removed "DEF+3" from Safety Ring. The def bonus is already listed in "Defense: 3" and was confusing players that
	  the accessory should give +6 DEF overall. [Poki#3]
	* Probably some things that I forgot xD [Poki#3]

2006/04/25
	* Another fix to TaeKwon Mission description, thanks to Vicious_Pucca. [Haplo]

	* Fixed item 2647 (Nile Rose) description, the HP bonus is +10 HP, plain, not +10% HP. [Haplo]
	* Changed some terms to use Maximum HP and Maximum SP as standard. [Haplo]

2006/04/19
	* Standardized some terms, changed all "Accuracy" to "HIT". Deleted all % relating to HIT and Flee bonuses, since in-game they has
	  always worked as plain bonuses, fixed some typos. [Haplo]
	* Changed the new hat to "Brazil Event Hat" (idea taken from Landarma), because "Event Hat" is a poor excuse of a name
	  and even the description says that its using their national flag colors, in a "Brazil Event" section. [Haplo]
	* Changed the Roguemaster's Bow (ID 1719) to be used only by Thiefs again. [Haplo]
	* Completely deleted LV 8 description from "Basic Skills", since Gravity dropped the idea and was deleted from KRO and IRO descriptions.
	  Reverted the Pick Stone skill Cast Time and Cool Down to 0.5 and 0 secs respectively. Also changed the Arrow Shower after-cast delay. [Haplo]
	* Committed the desc of the new Cards and Items. A lot of work, but it was worth it. Now just keep track of the patches for them :P [Poki#3]

2006/04/17

	* Fixed inconsistencies between some item names used in the skill descriptions and the real name of those items, thanks to DeathMeat. [Haplo]
	* Fixed a typo in NJ_ZENYNAGE description and the item requirements for AM_CREATECREATURE, thanks to DeathMeat. [Haplo]
	* Changed RG_FLAGGRAFFITI catalyst according to current IRO description. Also added a note for that skill and RG_CLEANER to indicate
	  that these skills are NOT implemented by Gravity yet. Please note that the catalyst mentioned for both skill DON'T exist yet. [Haplo]

	  CEASE to work when overweight. [Haplo]

2006/04/08
	* Added more info and updates regarding Gunslinger and Ninja skills. Big thanks to RockmanEXE for his research on Gunslinger skills. [Haplo]
	* Fixed some items displaying +% Flee bonus when they really give a plain +Flee bonus. This was IRO's mistake, since KRO descriptions
	  show them as plain +Flee bonus. Thanks to qazqazqaz for pointing out the problem. [Haplo]
	* The skills TF_MISS and BA_WHISTLE will appear now as giving plain +Flee Rate bonus, despite the websites showing a %.
	  This is because in reality they really work this way, and to avoid further confusions. Thanks again to qazqazqaz for pointing it out. [Haplo]

2006/04/06

2006/03/30
	* Changed items 1245 & 1246 to "Cinquedea" and item 2520 to "Goibne's Spaulders". IRO use these names and they are the proper denomination
	  for this italian sword and piece of armor. Changed descriptions to reflect this. [Haplo]
	* Changed item 12135 name, and item 7360 name and description to those used by current IRO translations. [Haplo]
	* Removed "RAW Translations" from Dev folder, since all of them have an official translation now. [Haplo]
	* Reverted item 4167 to "Neraid Card" to fit the monster's name. Truly nereids have nothing to do with Gravity's monster.
	  Why they have to be so inconsistent. >.< [Haplo]
	* Corrected KRO skill name typos, we dont need to follow their bad orthography. Updated skill descriptions with the new names. [Haplo]

	* Reverted Vesper Core's unidentified names back to "Accessory". Because IRO did that in their latest update (March 27th, 2006-3-27data_2.gpf),
	  and KRO files uses "Accessory" too. [Haplo]
	* Minor fixes to card names, map names... nothing much. [Poki#3]

2006/03/29
	* Changed ALL "Star Knight" references to "TaeKwon Master" in IRO skill descriptions, since this is the new name IRO implemented
	  in their latest skilldesctable (March 13th), all over the file. But they havent updated skillnametable for SL_STAR yet.
	  Don't blame me, blame IRO. >.> [Haplo]
	* Standardized some terms. [Haplo]
	* Fixed some skill descriptions, thanks to NLZ and ZeroXell for their reports. [Haplo]
	* Added a note to indicate Event Bonuses that no longer work once the event is finished, thanks to Lupus for pointing it out. [Haplo]
	* Fixed some skill SP costs according to latest KRO leveluseskillspamount.txt. [Haplo]
	* Changed some item descriptions according to today KRO patch and Lupus's note. [Haplo]
	* Changed a line in msgstringtable.txt according to latest IRO file. [Haplo]

2006/03/26

2006/03/23
	* Fixed several consistency errors among the files in items and skill descriptions, and some typos. Changed item 2282 name when Unidentified
	  from "Heaven Ring" to "Hairband", according to current KRO num2itemdisplaynametable. Corrected default and -hybrid skill descriptions for
	  MC_IDENTIFY using IRO name even when they are using KRO name in the skillnametable ^^;. Also added the now known CR_ACIDDEMONSTRATION
	  damage formula to the description. [Haplo]
	* Little fix on ST_PRESERVE description, thanks to BoomDivX for noticing. Added some missed changes on the GS and NJ skills. [Haplo]

2006/03/22
	* added this weeks balances for GS [midas]

2006/03/20
	* Added an explanation for the empty "Applicable Job" fields of items 5044 and 5051. Corrected SA_CREATECON skill description's recipies
	  to match the latest KRO skilldesctable (March 14th), changed ammount and names to match those used in the item files (verified the items
	  identity by comparing the korean names in description with the KRO idnum2itemdisplaynametable, to get their ID). [Haplo]

2006/03/19
	* Updated GS/NJ items with the changes done in the last KRO patch. [Haplo]

2006/03/17
	* Changed ATK for MATK in Estin and Estun skills, thanks to auronx, along with other minor changes in skill descriptions. [Haplo]

	* Fixed minor typos. [Haplo]

	  will add 20% bonus damage to Lightning Spear of Ice. Also, Water Ball and Aqua Benedicta's "effective range"
	  will also be decreased." 'cause i cant make sense of it, added to Todo [midas]
	* Fixed item 1719 Applicable Job, active guild skills Cast Time, GD_EMERGENCYCALL description and many "Required For" fields in skill files.
	  Also changed 2 wrong "Applicable Job" for "Applicable Pet". All this thanks to KarLaeda and his hard work. [Haplo]
	* Changed the NJ "Raging Dragon of Fire" skill name in default and "-iRO" to the better and shorter "Raging Fire Dragon". [Haplo]
	* Fixed typos here and there. In "Required For" field, now "Bard & Dancer" or "Clown & Gypsy" means a skill shared by both jobs
	  that can be used independently; and "Bard/Dancer" or "Clown/Gypsy" means an ensemble skill shared by both jobs that must be
	  executed by both. Also added "-SoulLinked" to those skills that can be obtained only through the Soul Linker skills. [Haplo]

2006/03/13
	* Added Level Dependencies to GS/NJ [midas]

2006/03/11
	* Merged update in SP costs for GS and NJ skills made in the default skilldesctable, into the "-iRO" and "-hybrid" files. [Haplo]
	* Merged the following Poki#3 work for items. The Gunslinger weapons received new IDs and were reorganized according to the new numbers.
	  Updated the description of the Gunslinger and Ninja items.
	- Maybe rename item 7517 to "Magical Gold Coin"? It would match the item description. [Haplo]
	* Reverted the change of the unidentified names of items 13006 to 13009, and 13012 to 13015; because of the update in their descriptions.
	  They are "Dagger" again, although I think is absurd that Gravity consider the Murasame as a dagger. <_< [Haplo]
	* Changed "Foot Gear" references to "Footgear", as is more consistent with the use of "Headgear" in descriptions. [Haplo]
	* After comments received about the format ":^777777 ", a preceding space is added ONLY for the item descriptions... to " :^777777 "
	  This way, the people that like the old format for items will see it in-game the same as before, while maintaining readability. [Haplo]
	* Fixed more typos in the new skills and added a missing "KRO Name" for GS_RAPIDSHOWER in the "-hybrid" descriptions. [Haplo]

2006/03/10
	* Finished GS/NJ skills. we still need more info, i have left the sp cost and the delays unedited so we can complete them easier.
		- hybrid tables have modified names that sound better.
		- still to do: sp cost and delays
		- what id is the gold coin used by GS? we should give a special name to that one "Dime" or something.
		- there are two items called "Gold Coin" in the item tables maybe one should be renamed "Gold Doubloon" to prvent mismatch.[midas]
	* Removed duplicated GS skill names and descriptions, the names given by midas were kept. Fixed some romanized Ninja skill names.
	  Sorted them with GS skills first and NJ later to match their job IDs (GS= 24, NJ= 25), for both names and descriptions.
	  Removed "IRO Name" and "KRO Name" fields from GS and NJ skills, since they will not be needed until IRO implement them.
	  Fixed typos of the new skills up to this point. [Haplo]
	* Updated the "-iRO" and "-hybrid" skillnametables with the skill names for GS and NJ provided by the default skillnametable.
	  - The "-iRO" and "-hybrid" skill descriptions for GS and NJ will be updated later, once they are finished. [Haplo]
	* Fixed ST_CHASEWALK description with correct STR bonuses, thanks to VNOM. [Haplo]
	* Reorganized items 13006-13015 descriptions to follow the itemdisplaynametable numeric order. [Haplo]

2006/03/09
	* Began work on ninja and gs skills. [midas]
	- i come to think of, we do 3 times the work just for changing skill names, mabe we should
		have a single file and provide different skill names through a diff. would be easier.
	* Fixed some format related typos found, and made some missed format changes. [Haplo]

2006/03/08
	* Fixed crashed text in changelog in last update. [Haplo]
	* Changed unidentified names of 13006 to 13009, and 13012 to 13015, from "dagger" to "sword" to be consistent with the items
	  description. Also changed "Kazemashuriken" for "Kazema Shuriken", and fixed related missed entries (Wind Ghost to Kazema). [Haplo]
	* More standardization and fixed some typos. As requested by KarLaeda, the use of spaces has been standardized in the items and
	  skills files; from " : ^777777", ":^777777", ": ^777777" and ":^777777 "... to only ":^777777 ", color format followed by space.
	  The change will not be noticeable in-game, but it improves the readability of the text with word processors. [Haplo]

2006/03/07
	* SL Skills, clarified description. minor changes to other skills.
	  - ppl be careful with the skilldescs, if a text line is too long it crashes the client [midas]

2006/03/06
	* Desc for GJ and NJ Equip (By Doddler, based on jRO) [Poki#3]

2006/03/02
	* Added GS and NJ Equip (plus some leftover items) [Poki#3]
	* Added Ninja to the "Applicable Job" section (Yeah. Gravity already did that Oo) [Poki#3]

2006/02/28
	* Changed Fricco's Shoes name to Freyr's Shoes, since is a much more widely known name for this god
	  and is consistent with the name used in the description. [Haplo]
	* Standardized and reorganized a little the item files, as preparation for the incoming new NJ and GS equipments. [Haplo]

2006/02/26
	* Some minor typos fix here and there. Updated some files in Dev folder. [Haplo]
	* Added skillnametable-hybrid.txt and skilldesctable-hybrid.txt. These files use mix flavored skill names between KRO and IRO,
	  and the skill names are decided upon Manipulator's discretion. The are no preference between KRO and IRO names for these files;
	  if the KRO skill name is used, the official IRO name is displayed at the bottom of description, if the IRO name is used,
	  the official KRO name is displayed at the bottom of description. If the name is different than both officials, both of them are
	  displayed at the bottom of description, with KRO Name preceding IRO Name. [Haplo]
	* Hopefully final fixes to the item desc and msg string table. Thanks to Haplo and Kumori. [Poki#3]
	* Changed all "Skel" to "Skeleton" (excluding Skel-Bone) [Poki#3]

2006/02/24

	  typos in skill descriptions and some missing name changes. [Haplo]

2006/02/18
	* Typo hunt of pettalktable.xml, and some else found around. Added lines <perfor_1>, <perfor_2>, <perfor_3> and <perfor_s>
	  for all those pets that were missing them (IRO table don't have them, but KRO table do), so now all pets will speak
	  when doing performances. Because of current eAthena development the line <perfor_s>, displayed at special performance,
	  is also displayed at login (instead of <connect>); so if you find it too annoying, you can delete the <perfor_s>
	  lines to avoid this behavior. Also standardized the format of the file. [Haplo]
	* Being now all files fully checked, I declare these files 99% typo free and give my Haplo ISO 9001 Certificate of Quality ;) [Haplo]

2006/02/03
	* Added Guild skill Charisma description. The desc is commented by default, since it glues to the precedent skill description.
	  This skill was dropped by Gravity, but is now added in the files just for completeness. [Haplo]
	* 3rd and final Stage of the skill updates:
	- Fixed the Tornado Stance missing line in iRO-Desc that I deleted by accident before. Thanks to auronx for reporting it.
	- Standardized some terms and abbreviations used in the formulas that appear in some descriptions.
	- Fixed typos everywhere. [Haplo]
	* Fixed a little typo in item 7399 description (that didn't match with the item's name). [Haplo]
	* Commented ALL the description lines of the commented items (Gunslinger and Ninja items), didn't found an easier way,
	  to avoid them being glued to Wandering Bard's Bow and Wind General descriptions. Thanks to auronx for reporting it. [Haplo]

2006/02/02
	* Updated items 2659, 2660, 2661, 2662, 7399, 7400, 7401, 7402, 7403, 7404 and 7173. [Poki#3]

2006/01/30
	* Made kRO Skill Translations the Default ones. [Poki#3]
	* Fixed some Item names. [Poki#3]
	* Reverted Lupus's change for now. Theres no such thing in kRO's Desc! [Poki#3]
	* Added +1 INT,+1 DEX to 5102#Blank_Eyes (Round Eyes) [Lupus]
	* Corrected items to "Citrine" and "Rudra's Bow", thanks to NLZ. [Haplo]
	* 2nd Stage of the skill updates:
	- Little corrections in skillnametable-kRO.txt
	- Updated skilldesctable-kRO.txt to be fully consistent with KRO name table. The rules of the changes are the reverse than before,
	  KRO Name precede IRO Name in description when the skill name used is not the official KRO name. [Haplo]
	* Fixed some missed name changes and typos here and there. Next step is a full typo search of all skill files. [Haplo]

2006/01/26
	* Reverted some skill names back to there proper ones. [Poki#3]
	* After cooking this thing for over a week, here is the 1st Stage of the skill updates (since is longer than I thought):
	- Changed obsolete "Attack Weak Point" for "Fatal Blow", thanks to NLZ.
	- Removed duplicate "Require for" line at GD_BATTLEORDER, thanks to timexy.
	- Made the default skillnametable more iRO like using the updated iRO skill files present in their sdata.grf,
	  since now we have an alternate kRO-name version. Some names were left unchanged after suggestions of Poki#3,
	  Manipulator and midas. Some because their name is too popular (Asura, Spiral Pierce),
	  default name don't match well with skill (Summon Flora, Spear Dynamo), etc. For the KA and ES Soul Linker skills,
	  those in the name table were used, I think that Vicious will know better if they must be changed.
	- Changed skilldesctable.txt accordingly to be fully consistent with the name's table. Rules of these changes are:
		1) iRO name is prefered.
		2) If the iRO name is different from kRO, the kRO name is displayed at the bottom of description.
		3) If the only difference between iRO and kRO is a compound vs. uncompound word (Demonbane/Demon Bane), 1 was chosen for both.
		4) If an alternate name is used, the official iRO name is displayed at the bottom of description.
		5) If the alternate name is NOT the official kRO name, the kRO name is also displayed below of the iRO name in description.
	- Corrected some names in skillnametable-kRO.txt to use the official names found on kRO website when an english name
	  was given in parethesis.
	- Corrected Frenzy Lord Knight Skill requirements (currently don't have, only Job level 50). [Haplo]
	* Corrected few typos, 2nd Stage will be the consistency check of kRO descriptions with the kRO name table.
	  Serious typo search of skill files will come later. If I missed something, please let me know. [Haplo]

2006/01/24
	* Fixed Dryad Card and Karakasa Card. New desc for item 12134 [Poki#3]

2006/01/17
	* Changed remaining Taekwon > TaeKwon, fixed a couple of typos. [Haplo]
	* Changed Luna Bow to Lunar Bow, thanks to NLZ, and modified the description a bit. [Haplo]
	* Typo hunting on mapnametable, metalprocessitemlist and [custom]monstertalktable. Hunt was good. [Haplo]
	* Renamed "ba_frostjoke2.txt" to "[alternative]ba_frostjoke.txt" [Poki#3]
	* Renamed "monstertalktable.xml" to "[custom]monstertalktable.xml". [Poki#3]

	  Taken from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding
	  Grinding is a form of preparing food for eating, or for use in other forms of cooking.
	  For example, bread and pasta rely on grinding of the flour, the production of tahini
	  (sesame seed paste) involves grinding of the seeds, ground almonds are an important ingredient in many dishes.
	 Also we had some nonsens like "plant is ground well and eaten" or "filled with ground meat"
