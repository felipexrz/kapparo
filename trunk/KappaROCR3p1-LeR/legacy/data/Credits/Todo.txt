12.
Description:	hidden water and bonus to lightning sper of ice and waterball

Status:		Pending (0%).

Assigned:	None

Notes:		from Lune: "When using Lightning Spear of Ice on top of Hidden Water, at maximum skill level, will add 20% bonus damage to Lightning Spear of Ice. Also, Water Ball and Aqua Benedicta's "effective range" will also be decreased."
					- cant make sense of this: is to ONLY? at max LSpear level or at Hidden Water? effective range of AB??? AB has 0 range? does it mean waterball "balls" or range?

		My guess is that it refers to "Lightning Spear of Ice" max level to receive the bonus, since he is refering to that skill and it would be more logical to have the bonus attached to the damaging skill (Hidden Water dont do damage).
		By "effective range" maybe he refers that the puddle will expire faster than before when Water Ball and Aqua Benedicta are used??? To avoid spamming those skills in the Hidden Water's puddle??? [Haplo]
