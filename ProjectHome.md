<ul><li>If you experience ANY difficulties, please refer it to an online staff member.</li></ul>

<b>Contact</b><font color='PURPLE'><a href='ADM.md'>ADM</a> kattun<font color='BLACK'> for any issue regarding your client crashing or major bug.<br>
<br>
<b>If the Admin is not available, or if you have a general gameplay question, contact</b><font color='PURPLE'><a href='GM.md'>GM</a> KaChan.<font color='BLACK'>

<ul><li>If you do something that creates a client-related issue, such as obtaining a bugged equip stopping you from logging back on, then only Kattun can fix it via the databases. Therefore, <font color='RED'>IF WE FIX YOUR ACCOUNT, PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT YOUR MISTAKE. Modifying the databases takes time, and the Admin is busy as it is working on other issues. Believe me, there is not enough hours in the day to fix every little problem.<b></li></ul></b>
